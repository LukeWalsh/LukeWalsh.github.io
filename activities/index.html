        <h2>
            Programming
        </h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy programming because it allows me to imagine, design, and build things faster than any other field. I learned to program my freshman year of college, and have been self teaching myself since then. I think classrooms have a place, but I tend to learn best by building things on my own.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Camping
        </h2>
        <p>
            I grew up a Boy Scout, and am proud to call myself an Eagle Scout. The outdoors has always been where I feel the most calm, and I enjoy all sorts of activities outside.

        <h2>
            Skiing
        </h2>
        <p>
            I fell in love with skiing the very first time I stepped onto a mountain in the winter. Something about the snowy trees never ceases to make me feel like I have found paradise.

        <h2>
            Longboarding
        </h2>
        <p>
            Growing up Longboarding was always a great way to cheat death at 45mph, one hill at a time. Nowadays it's still my favorite method of transportation between classes, and on urban sidewalks.

        <h2>
            Ms. Pac-Man 
        </h2>
        <p>
            The only video game I play consistently, I have to try out any machine I come across. I wont bother posting my score, but I definitely get my moneys worth on a 25 cent run.

        <h2>
            Rock Climbing
        </h2>
        <p>
            I like climbing beause it's like a logic puzzle for your body. In school I climb regularly at the Purdue rec center bouldering wall.
